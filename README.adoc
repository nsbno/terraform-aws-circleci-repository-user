== About

This module makes it easy and safe to manage and distribute access to your deployments.

== Setup

The setup happens in your team's `<team>-aws` repository.
Here you will set up the module, which handles integration with CircleCI.

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
module "circleci_user" {
  source = "https://github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-circleci-repository-user?ref=x.y.z"

  name_prefix = "deployment"

  artifact_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-artifact-bucket"
}
----


== Getting access to the user

When you have run terraform to create the user, it is accessible via two SSM parameters:

* https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters/ci/user-id/description?region=eu-west-1&tab=Table[/ci/user-id]
* https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters/ci/user-secret/description?region=eu-west-1&tab=Table[/ci/user-secret]

Put these into your CircleCI context!
